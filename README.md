# MultiVersusModManager
A simple (and kinda scuffed) mod manager for the game MultiVersus.
This is entirely still W.I.P so expect shortcomings, bugs, and glitches.
Also note that the release version will most likely not contain some stuff the source has.

Please note if the mod manager is getting flagged by windows anti-virus please temporarily turn it off or add the program as an exception in the windows settings. 
If you are getting file access denied (or something to that affect) pleasse run the mod manager as admin.
