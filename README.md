# MultiVersus Mod Manager (MVMM)
A simple (and kinda scuffed) mod manager for the game MultiVersus.
This is entirely still W.I.P so expect shortcomings, bugs, and glitches.
Also note that the release version will most likely not contain some stuff the source has.

# File Systems
If the auto find folder doesn't work then you will have to manually select your MultiVersus Pak folder. The directory should be something like SteamLibrary\MultiVersus\MultiVersus\Content\Paks . Once the paks folder is selected the program will automatically make a Mods folder. You will need to put all the mods in that folder manually.  

# Troubleshooting
- If the mod manager is getting flagged by windows anti-virus temporarily turn it off or add the program as an exception in the windows settings. 
- If you are getting file access denied (or something to that affect) run the mod manager as admin.
